    '<p><u>Switchbacks: Ascending the Catskill Mountain High Peaks</u> is a work of Literary Nonfiction encompassing the genres of nature writing, memoir, and essay. It clarifies a contribution to: 1) theory and practice of Literary Nonfiction, especially in the genres of nature writing, memoir, essay, and narrative journalism and 2) Catskills literary regionalism. The work is organized in two parts: 1) a critical discussion of the scholarly and artistic context and creation of the Catskill essays; and 2) the <u>Switchbacks</u> Introduction and seven essays.<p>',
    'This theory of Literary Nonfiction examines the works of Aristotle, Charles Darwin, Ayn Rand, Barry Lopez, Steven Pinker, and the following literary, scientific, and philosophic movements: mimesis, Objectivism, natural selection, realism, and naturalism. Established is a basis for the accuracy of a work of Literary Nonfiction. Three specific claims support the accuracy of Literary Nonfiction: 1) Nonfiction evolves in a metaphorical process similar to Darwin’s theory of evolution; 2) Facts in the landscape are represented as facts in a narrative by the act of a rational mind; and 3) When the pattern of thought reflects the pattern of the landscape, mind and reality are integrated in an accurate narrative.',
    'This creative work makes a contribution to Catskills literary regionalism. The works of John Burroughs, the artistic works of Thomas Cole, and ecological work of Michael Kudish are examined. The architectural narrative of this work of Literary Nonfiction is what is called “switchbacks,” for the narrative structure is the same as the trail structure in the Catskills. These are climbing narratives on three levels: 1. evolution; 2. adaptation; 3. integration. The work is comprised of a an Introduction that examines the Kaaterskill Falls area and seven chapters. The seven chapters chronicle Catskill high peak climbs of 1. Blackhead Range; 2. Windham; 3. Plateau; 4. Hunter; 5. Slide; 6. Balsam Lake; 7. Graham. The structure of the work as a whole is a dragon’s back in that each peak contains a subplot with rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, plus the whole work has a main climax of the same pattern.',
