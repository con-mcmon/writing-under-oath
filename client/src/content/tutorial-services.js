      <p>We charge $1 per page for proofreading, grammatical corrections, and in-depth fact checking. We can add literary tweaking to your manuscript to make it more beautiful and readable. We serve students, academics, professionals, businesses.</p>
      <p>To submit your manuscript for a price quote and analysis, please provide a $21 reader fee to be deducted from the final cost or your completely edited manuscript. In the event that you choose not to leave your piece with us for editing, your $21 will still get you something of value: A one-page review of the strengths and weaknesses of your writing, where and upon what to focus, and our professional suggestions about the overall potential evolution that your manuscript might achieve.</p>
